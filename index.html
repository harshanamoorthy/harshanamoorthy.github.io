					<p>üëãüèΩ Hello! I&rsquo;m <strong>Harshana</strong> &mdash; or <strong>Ana</strong>, as someone calls me.</p>
					<p>After graduating from <a href="http://www.amrita.edu/">Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a>, with a bachelor&rsquo;s on <a href="https://www.amrita.edu/program/btech-computer-science-and-engineering">Computer Sciences and Engineering</a> degree, I started working for <a href="https://appviewx.com/">AppViewX</a>, a company that is &ldquo;revolutionizing the manner in which NetOps and SecOps teams deliver services to the rest of Enterprise IT,&rdquo; as a Solutions Sales Engineer.</p>
					<p>I rose through the company&rsquo;s ranks to Customer Success Engineer, and currently as a Senior Solutions Engineer. Amongst my many responsibilities, I am an active participant on AppViewX's products strategic discussions, as well as an on-the-field engineer, in charge of identifying and analysing customer's requirements, performing complex on-site deployments, and further tailoring the product's development to meet customer's needs. You can read more about what I do on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshana-moorthy-4ab389171">LinkedIn page</a>. Automation workflows and orchestration are my bread and butter, and I take great pleasure in helping customers to succeed effortlessly.</p>
					<p>This page is a place-holder, while I find the time to starting blogging about software development, automation, orchestration, and much more in between. In the mean time, if you need to contact me, emails can be sent &mdash; and will be answered expediently, as time permits &mdash; to my <a href="mailto:harshana+blog@moorthy.me">email address</a>.</p>
